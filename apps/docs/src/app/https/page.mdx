# HTTPS

HTTP/2 + TLS for faster dev server page loads. Browsers limit HTTP/1.1 to 6 connections per host, which bottlenecks dev servers serving many unbundled files. HTTP/2 multiplexes all requests over a single connection.

## Enable HTTPS

```bash
peakroute proxy start --https
```

First run generates a local CA and server certs, then prompts for sudo once to trust the CA. After that -- no prompts, no browser warnings.

## Make it permanent

Add to `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
export PORTLESS_HTTPS=1
```

Now `peakroute proxy start` uses HTTPS by default.

## Custom certificates

Use your own certs (e.g., from mkcert):

```bash
peakroute proxy start --cert ./cert.pem --key ./key.pem
```

Both flags imply `--https`.

## Trust the CA later

If you skipped the sudo prompt on first run:

```bash
sudo peakroute trust
```

## Disable HTTPS

Override the environment variable:

```bash
peakroute proxy start --no-tls
```
