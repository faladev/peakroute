# Commands

## Run an app

```bash
peakroute <name> <cmd> [args...]
```

Starts your command and maps it to `http://<name>.localhost:1355`. Auto-starts the proxy if needed.

```bash
peakroute myapp next dev
peakroute api bun start
peakroute docs.myapp next dev
```

## List routes

```bash
peakroute list
```

Shows active routes and their assigned ports.

## Trust the CA

```bash
sudo peakroute trust
```

Adds the peakroute certificate authority to your system trust store. Required once for HTTPS with auto-generated certs.

## Proxy control

```bash
peakroute proxy start
```

      <td>`-p, --port <number>`</td>
      <td>Proxy port (default: 1355). Below 1024 requires sudo.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`--https`</td>
      <td>Enable HTTP/2 + TLS with auto-generated certs</td>
    </tr>

```
